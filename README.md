WIP project to use opencv to recognize number within a computers window. Orginally designed recognize health values in the Video Game 'Fortnite', 
however due to the UI elements within game creating a significant amount of background noise around the player's health value the program is not
entirely accurate, especially on certain numbers. Was orginally designed to detect drops in health to send signals to an outside device via serial input.

This project can still be salvaged for other purposes by changing the "window name" for window captured and by Changing the coordinates within the window
you would like to capture.
